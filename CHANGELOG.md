# Changelog

All notable changes to the Melomaniac Studios site rebuild.

## [Unreleased]

### Added — generative hero (first pass)
- Repository initialized as a standalone static site (no more Webflow embeds).
- `index.html` — single-file standalone build.
- Design tokens wired to the `DESIGN.md` palette (`--green` #B8F06E, warm ivory paper,
  warm ink, hairline).
- Typography: Fraunces (variable, opsz axis) for display + tagline italics; Inter for UI.
  No monospace, no Bebas Neue.
- Hero section:
  - Full-viewport Three.js "sound-form" on warm ivory (`--paper`).
  - Built from 8/10/12/16-fold star polygons and radial spokes (rosette + girih-inspired
    geometry, rendered as pure math — never named as such in-page).
  - Ink hairlines against paper with green traces woven at ~12% of the line work; one
    green concentric hairline and one small radial accent, per the "one confident green
    moment per viewport" rule.
  - ~280-particle drift field (12% green), gentle z-shimmer.
  - Seeded per load from date+hour+minute → fold count, chord steps, rotation phase,
    accent placement all vary; slow visible evolution over ~20–30s.
  - Cursor perturbation on rotation; passive on touch.
  - `prefers-reduced-motion` → single static poster frame, no rAF.
  - DPR capped at 2; assembly scales/offsets by aspect for portrait, tablet, wide.
- Overlaid content per spec: eyebrow ("Melomaniac Studios · Toronto"), stacked wordmark
  (roman + italic Fraunces at display scale), tagline "A house for sound.", quiet scroll cue.
  Nothing else in the hero.
- `::selection` → green fill, ink text (site-wide signature).
- `_reference/` — the old Webflow head+body preserved for functionality port
  (Supabase auth, Frequency quiz data, Manifold WebGL).

### Pending review
- Serving locally at http://localhost:4200 — awaiting founder approval on the hero feel
  before styling any other section (per DESIGN.md §7 workflow).

### Next
- The House editorial index (four pillars as equals).
- Labs featured spotlight (allowed the boldest chartreuse band on the page).
- Pillar pages restyled; Melomania dark inversion allowed.
- Early Access restyled; port waitlist + Frequency + Manifold logic from `_reference/`.
- GitHub Pages + custom domain once the full site is approved.
